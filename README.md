# Fundamentals of Web Development, 2nd Edition
### Chapter 3 [HTML 1], Project 3 [Art Store]

Hands-on practice projects are present in many chapters throughout this textbook
and relate the content matter back to a few overarching examples: an art store, a
travel website, and a customer relationship management (CRM) portal for a book
representative. These projects come with images, databases, and other files, and are
included with your purchase of this textbook.

This project is the first step in the creation of an art store website. Unlike the previous
exercises, your task is to create an HTML page from scratch based on the image
in Figure 3.30.
